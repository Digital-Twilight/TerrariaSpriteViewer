# Terraria Sprite Viewer 
[![build](https://github.com/Digital-Twilight/TerrariaSpriteViewer/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Digital-Twilight/TerrariaSpriteViewer/actions/workflows/build.yml)


This program is designed to view sprites from the game Terraria. It simplifies the process of creating textures, as you no longer need to open Terraria every time to see how a new texture looks.

# Setup Instructions
1) Create a folder named <code>Images</code> in the same directory as the executable file. Inside the <code>Images</code> folder, create a subfolder named <code>Armor</code>.

    The structure should look like this:
    ```
    - SpriteViewer.exe
    - Images
      - Armor
        ...
      ...
    ...
    ```
    <code>(This matches the texture pack structure in Terraria)</code>

3) Ensure the Images folder contains the following files:
    ```
    Player_0_0.png
    Player_0_7.png
    Player_0_10.png
    ```
3) Open the program.

4) That's it! Everything is ready to go!
